# Credit Score Classification

## Overview
This project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering using R programming languages. The goal is to classify credit score.

## Files
- `data/raw/`: The original dataset used in the project.
- `data/processed/`: The cleaned and processed dataset exported after data cleaning and preprocessing steps.



## R Version
### Libraries Used
- data.table
- ggplot2
- corrplot
- cowplot

### Steps
1. Data loading and inspection using data.table.
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Converting data types.
   - Removing outliers.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
   - Creating a correlation matrix heatmap.
4. Feature engineering:
   - Creating new features based on existing ones.
5. Encoding categorical variables using factor() and as.factor().
6. Exporting the cleaned and processed data to a CSV file.
